\format{
A data frame with 4668373 rows and 6 variables
\describe{
 \item{CHR}{chromosome name, in UCSC format chrN}
 \item{START}{start genomic coordinate, UCSC format}
 \item{END}{start genomic coordinate, UCSC format}
 \item{STRAND}{strand}

}
\source{
From CosmicCodingMuts.vcf file for hg38 downloaded from
https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/download and saved in data-raw as
CosmicCodingMuts_hg38.vcf . The dataset was then subset through random 
stratified sampling to max 10.000 snv per chromosome.

COSMIC_hg38_demo
}
\description{
A dataset containing coding mutations from COSMIC for genome assembly hg38
Since the COSMIC dataset is very large and it requires registration we are
bundleing in the package a very small version, just enough to demo the
package vignette and test suite. Please refer on the documentation 
vignette/HOWTO_Import_external_data.html on how to retrieve and 
use COSMIC data with TMBleR.
}
\details{
data("COSMIC_hg38_demo") will load the demo dataset as a "COSMIC_hg38
 object in the global env
